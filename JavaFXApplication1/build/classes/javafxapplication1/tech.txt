What exactly is Artificial Intelligence? It is basically the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially computer programs.


The ability to invent intelligent machines has fascinated humans since the ancient times. Researchers are creating systems and programs that could mimic human thoughts and try doing things that human could do. The artificial Intelligence is a combination of computer science, physiology and philosophy.

The Artificial Intelligence has come a long way from the old days. It was with the invention of the computers that the Artificial Intelligence method began to maneuver researchers. The technology was finally available and seemed to stimulate intelligent behavior. Intelligent here means, things which could be done at a faster pace and thinking than a human mind. The insights and theory brought about the Artificial Intelligence will set a trend in the future. The current products are just the beginning of the future trend.

Humans can expand their knowledge to adapt the changing environment. To do that they must “learn”. Learning can be simply defined as the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught. Although learning is an easy task for most of the people, to acquire new knowledge or skills from data is too hard and complicated for machines. Moreover, the intelligence level of a machine is directly relevant to its learning capability. The study of machine learning tries to deal with this complicated task. In other words, machine learning is the branch of artificial intelligence that tries to find an answer to this question: how to make computer learn?

When we say that the machine learns, we mean that the machine is able to make predictions from examples of desired behavior or past observations and information. More formal definition of machine learning by Tom Mitchell is A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. The definition also indicates the main goal of machine learning: the design of such programs.

Machine learning is a hot topic at the moment, not only since Google’s AlphaGo AI managed to beat the human world champion in the highly complex game of Go. Like computer vision, it is seen as a key factor for automation in various fields like autonomous cars. Computer intelligence a relatively new field at the intersection of computer science and mathematics. The aim is to develop computer models that can, after being fed with training data, generalize and realize patterns and relations – making computers able to learn independently. Visual computing on the other hand aims at the automated perception and and understanding of visual data. It is a highly complex task and by far not as easy as it sounds at first.

Machine learning helps computers understand what they see

So is state-of-the-art computer vision only possible with machine learning technology behind it? Not really. The task of gathering and processing optical input in such a way that it might assist or even replace human vision is complex. So computer vision methods nowadays leverage intelligent algorithms and systems. Even to an extent that visual computing has become one of the main fields of this technology’s successful application. Computer vision, however, is more than machine learning applied. It involves tasks as 3D scene modeling, multi-view camera geometry, structure-from-motion, stereo correspondence, point cloud processing, motion estimation and more, where machine learning is not a key element.

We will see a lot of applications of both technologies. Most interesting probably where benefits of both are combined: Self driving cars, microscopy and the analysis and processing of generated images or robotics, just to name a few.
